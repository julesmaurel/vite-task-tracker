# React + Vite

Task tracker in React, build with Vite, following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t

To run locally:

- copy repo and cd to the root
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev` to start the app locally to port 3000
- in another terminal tab, `npm run server` to start json-server (mock REST API) on port 3003

Note: the db works fine locally, but not on Gihub pages as it's only for static pages
