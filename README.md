# React + Vite

Task tracker in React, built with Vite, following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t, and expanded with MongoDB.

To run locally:

Add your MongoDB key in `server/.env`

- copy repo and cd to the root
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev` to start the app locally to port 3000
- in another terminal tab, `cd server` then `node server.mjs` to start the local server pointing to MongoDB on port 3003

Note: the db works fine locally, but not on Gihub pages as it's only for static pages
